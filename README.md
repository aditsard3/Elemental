# Elemental
An education app I created for Android

##About
Just do whatever you want with this app. It gives you an element symbol and you type in the name, super simple. I wrote this app to be very simple and it's good code to look at when learning the AndroidSDK.

##Building
The app requires Android Studio to run. Clone this to your desktop and then open the repo in AS. Build under the build menu

##You can do a lot of things with this code, but you can't:
Put it on the Play Store
<br>
Take credit for it
<br>
Make useless commits to the repo

###Danke, Matt
