# Elemental
An education app my friend and I created for Android.
<br>
You can grab the APK build file from [my Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ry4in3jfyozn5gt/app-debug.apk?dl=0)

##About
Just do whatever you want with this app. It gives you an element symbol and you type in the name, super simple. I wrote this app with a friend to be very simple and it's good code to look at when learning the AndroidSDK.

##Building
The app requires Android Studio to run. Clone this to your desktop and then open the repo in AS. Build under the "Build" menu.
If you want to run our build or are just lazy, you can find an APK build [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ry4in3jfyozn5gt/app-debug.apk?dl=0)

##You can do a lot of things with this code, but you can't:
Put it on the Play Store
<br>
Take credit for it
<br>
Make useless commits to the repo

###Thanks, Matt
